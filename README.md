# Portfolio Theory

This is a course text for an undergraduate level course in Portfolio Theory.  Eventually, it will cover from a general introduction to risk, through Markowitz, to the CAPM/APT, and end with some modern stat arb strategies.   It is written in RMarkdown and contains interactive content, through embedded Shiny apps. See this link http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html for a description of Shiny/RMarkdown.
